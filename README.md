# API-Based Web App Registration and Purchase Management System

This API-based web application, developed using Java, Spring Boot, HTML, and CSS, provides a user-friendly interface for managing user accounts and purchase records. It leverages the power of a SQL database to store and retrieve account information, purchase details, and product quantities. The services are exposed as an API, allowing clients to interact with the application programmatically.
